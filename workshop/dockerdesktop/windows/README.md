# Docker Desktop for Windows

Docker Desktop is a one-click-install application for your Windows environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices.

## Architecture of Docker Desktop for Windows


Docker CLI running on the host machine executes commands within the Docker Integration Package, which runs on the remote WSL VM.

DockerD runs directly within WSL so there's no need for the Hyper-V VM and all Linux containers run within the Linux userspace on Windows for improved performance and compatibility.

## Installation

By default, Docker Desktop is installed at the following location:

```
C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker
```


# Support

Docker only supports Docker Desktop on Windows for those versions of Windows 10 that are still within Microsoftâ€™s servicing timeline.

[Docker Desktop for Windows can run inside a virtual desktop provided the virtual desktop is properly configured.](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/vm-vdi/)


## FAQs?

## Que:1  Is it possible to share containers and images between user accounts?

Containers and images created with Docker Desktop are shared between all user accounts on machines where it is installed. This is because all Windows accounts use the same VM to build and run containers. Note that it is not possible to share containers and images between user accounts when using the Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend.
